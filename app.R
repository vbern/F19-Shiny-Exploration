# Shiny Tutorial for Rgronomists/LunchinatoRs

# Created from RStudio Shiny app template (file -> new file -> Shiny Web App)

#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.

# Every shiny app is built from two parts: a user interface (ui) and a server.
# The user interface is HTML written using the shiny functions.
# The server is the instructions that tell the web page what to show when the user
#     interacts with the page.

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
   
   # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
   sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
         sliderInput("bins",
                     "Number of bins:",
                     min = 1,
                     max = 50,
                     value = 30)
      ),
      
      # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      mainPanel(
         plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
   )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
   
   output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
      # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
      x    <- faithful[, 2] 
      bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
      
      # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
      hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
   })
}

# Run the application
